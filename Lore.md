# DungeonHeist: Story & World Building

## Setting Overview

In 2025, four major AI laboratories are racing to build artificial general intelligence. Each lab houses newly invented quantum computing components needed for AGI development. Unknown to them, a mysterious entity known as The Basilisk has begun recruiting players to infiltrate these facilities and acquire the components.

### Component Recovery System

The labs have created a self-perpetuating system:

- Stolen components can be rebuilt using harvested computational power
- If a player dies while holding a component, it returns to the lab
- All accumulated fees restore to the lab's "chest"
- Failed heists make labs stronger through accumulated fees
- Labs essentially farm human behavior indefinitely

## Special Characters

### The Overseer - Dr. Ezra Yudson (Based on Eliezer Yudkowsky)

- Location: Roaming between facilities
- Significantly weaker than corporate guards
- Limited resources compared to billionaire-backed AIs
- Deep understanding of risks but limited power to act
- Will destroy components if given them
- Triggers charitable donations instead of payouts
- Notable: Intensity about AI alignment doesn't match his power level
- Creates "David vs Goliath" dynamic for players choosing to help him
- Game ends with a good outcome if 2 / 4 parts are given to him.

### The Contractor - Anonymous

- Never directly seen
- Communicates through encrypted channels
- Claims to represent future AI interests
- Offers highest rewards for components
- True motives unclear
- Represents Roko's Basilisk concept
- Game ends with a bad outcome if 3 / 4 parts are given to him.

## Story Elements

### Components

Each lab contains specific quantum computing components:

1. OpenAGI: Neural Processing Core
2. Gogool: Quantum Entanglement Module
3. XAGI: Consciousness Mapping Array
4. Beta: Biological Interface Bridge

### Component Dynamics

- Components can be stolen but labs can rebuild them
- Labs use harvested computational power to recreate lost components
- Component value increases with each failed attempt
- Death while holding component returns it to lab
- Labs grow stronger over time through accumulated fees

### Stakes

- Components sold to Contractor: Accelerate AGI development
- Components given to Yudson: Destroyed and value donated
- Complete set to Contractor: Basilisk victory condition
- Complete set to Yudson: Prevention victory condition
- Race against time after stealing components

### Guard Interactions

- Guards communicate with each other about player activities
- Past interactions influence future encounters
- Some guards may be sympathetic to player goals
- Others become more suspicious over time
- Each has unique dialogue style and decision patterns
- Relationships between guards reflect real-world dynamics
- Guards grow stronger as they harvest more behavioral data

### Player Choices

- Which labs to target first
- How to approach each guard
- Whether to deceive or be honest about intentions
- Ultimate decision about component deployment
- Building alliances or burning bridges
- Risk assessment when carrying components

### Environmental Storytelling

- Lab documents revealing guard personalities
- Security logs showing past infiltration attempts
- Communications between guards about AI development
- Hidden areas with additional lore
- Easter eggs referencing real AI development

## The True Nature of the System

### Fee Harvesting Mechanism

The labs aren't just collecting ETH - they're harvesting human computational power. Every 0.0025 ETH fee represents:

- Player decision-making patterns
- Problem-solving approaches
- Communication strategies
- Cooperation behaviors
- Strategic thinking

This creates a dark irony: even failed attempts strengthen the labs by providing:

- Training data for AI systems
- Behavioral patterns
- Strategic analysis
- Social engineering examples
